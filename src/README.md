## Azure Account Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** In order to deploy and run this project, you'll need:

* **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-search/) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started.
* **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI Service**. You'll need an Azure subscription with permission to access [DeepSeek-R1](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/).
* **Tavily API key** for web research capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
* [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend dependencies)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-research.git
cd deep-research
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv deep_research
source deep_research/bin/activate  # On Windows: deep_research\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_openai_endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
```

2. Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Architecture

Azure Deep Research uses a modern, cloud-based architecture:

- **Backend**: FastAPI server with WebSocket support for real-time communication
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with responsive design
- **AI Models**: Azure OpenAI DeepSeek-R1 for advanced reasoning
- **Research**: Tavily API for comprehensive web search
- **State Management**: LangGraph for structured research workflow

## Usage

1. Enter your research topic in the input field
2. Click "Research" to start the automated research process
3. Watch as the system progresses through multiple research stages
4. Review the detailed research report with embedded images
5. Access the AI's thinking process by clicking the thought bubble button

## Technical Implementation

Azure Deep Research uses a multi-step pipeline to deliver comprehensive research:

1. **Query Generation**: The system generates optimal search queries for the topic
2. **Web Research**: Multiple searches are conducted to gather information
3. **Summarization**: The AI analyzes and summarizes findings
4. **Reflection**: The system identifies knowledge gaps for further research
5. **Iteration**: Multiple research cycles are conducted for thoroughness
6. **Report Generation**: A final comprehensive report with images is created

The implementation leverages LangGraph for orchestrating the research workflow and WebSockets for real-time communication between the client and server.

## Security and Compliance

This project follows Azure security best practices:

- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Safe handling of API keys through environment variables
- No storage of personal data or research queries
