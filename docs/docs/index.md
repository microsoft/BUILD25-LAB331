# LAB331: Deep Research with LangChain and DeepSeek R1

Welcome to Lab 331! In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how 'reasoning models' like DeepSeek R1 work. We'll walk through how to build an AI-powered research assistant that can conduct comprehensive web research, analyze and synthesize information, and present findings with illustrative images. The researcher's API will be built using Langchain Azure AI, DeepSeek R1, LangGraph (Langchain's agentic framework) and FastAPI.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you'll have learnt:

- What a Reasoning Model is and how to use one
- How to use Reasoning Models with tools like Tavily web search for optimum search results
- What LangGraph is and how to implement reflection style archictecture with it
- How to use LangGraph to perform iterative research cycles to build comprehensive knowledge
- How to deploy the final application

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is organized into four labs:

1. **Reasoning & Model Thoughts**
2. **Web Research Integration**
3. **Research Reflection**
4. **Launching Your Researcher**

## Getting Started

To begin the workshop, proceed to the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) section to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies.
