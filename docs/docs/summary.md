# Workshop Summary

Congratulations on completing the workshop! Let's recap what you've learned and built throughout this journey.

## In this workshop you built a deep researcher that uses DeepSeek R1 to complete the following steps:

1. **Query Generation**: Query generation based on the users research topic input 
2. **Web Search**: Searching the web based on the generated query
3. **Summarization**: Summarization of the web search results into a report
4. **Knowledge Gap Identification**: Reflection on the summary and identification of specific knowledge gaps to fill
5. **Follow-up search cycles**: Iterative search and reflection cycles based on identified gaps
6. **Final Report**: Synthesis of all findings into a comprehensive report

## In completing the workshop you learnt:

- What a reasoning model is and how to use DeepSeek R1
- How to use reasoning models with tools like [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com) web search for optimum search results
- What [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) is and how to implement reflection style archictecture with it
- How to use LangGraph to perform iterative research cycles to build comprehensive knowledge
- How to launch the final application

By understanding the core components and patterns, you can extend this framework to solve a wide range of problems!

Thank you for participating in this workshop. We hope you've gained valuable skills.
